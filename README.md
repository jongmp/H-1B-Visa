# Exploratory Data Analysis of H-1B Visas
H-1B visa is a visa in the United States under the Immigration and Nationality Act, section 101(a)(15)(H) that allows 
U.S. employers to temporarily employ foreign workers in specialty occupations. A specialty occupation requires the application 
of specialized knowledge and a bachelor’s degree or the equivalent of work experience. [(source Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-1B_visa)

## Data
The H-1B Dataset selected for this project contains data from employer’s Labor Condition Application and the case 
certification determinations processed by the Office of Foreign Labor Certification (OFLC). The Labor Condition Application 
(LCA) is a document that a perspective H-1B employer files with U.S. Department of Labor Employment and Training 
Administration (DOLETA) when it seeks to employ non-immigrant workers at a specific job occupation in an area of 
intended employment for not more than three years. The datasets are from the [Department of Labor's website.](https://www.foreignlaborcert.doleta.gov/performancedata.cfm#dis)

They can all be found in this [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/jmpark746/h1b-visas)
